# Micromouse Project 2025

Welcome to the **Micromouse Project 2025** repository! This project is part of the EEE3097S, EEE3098S, and EEE3099S courses at the University of Cape Town. It focuses on the procedural and system-level design of an autonomous micro-mouse capable of navigating a maze using a combination of MATLAB, Simulink, and Stateflow tools.

## 🎯 Objectives

This project aims to:

- Build on prior design experience (from EEE3088F).
- Use formal design methods to develop a system-level solution.
- Simulate, implement, and test control strategies for autonomous maze navigation.
- Design robust software models that can be deployed to physical hardware via embedded code generation.

By the end of this project, the micro-mouse should autonomously:
- Explore and map a maze.
- Determine an optimal path.
- Navigate from a start point to a target as efficiently as possible.
